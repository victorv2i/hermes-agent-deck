/**
 * The app router. The {@link App} layout owns the chrome (rail · header) and
 * renders the active surface in its content Outlet. Surfaces are
 * derived 1:1 from the {@link NAV} registry — appending a NavItem there is the
 * only edit needed to add a route.
 *
 * The `/history` surface is still routed (its `chats` NAV entry is `hidden` — it
 * folded into Chat in the rail, but the route survives for deep-links, ⌘K, and
 * the mobile "Past chats" button in the chat header).
 *
 * Beyond the registry there are a few hand-authored, non-NAV children:
 *  - `/profiles` → `/` + `/profiles/:name` → `/?agent=<name>` REDIRECTS: the
 *    Agents roster + the per-agent hub folded into the Agent Studio (Home); the
 *    old paths forward there (the `:name` deep link opens that agent).
 *  - `/tools` → `/` REDIRECT: the Tools surface became a Studio section.
 *  - `/memory` → `/` + `/skills` → `/` REDIRECTS: the standalone Memory/Soul +
 *    Skills surfaces folded into the agent's authoring surface (now the Studio).
 *  - `/connections` → `/?view=connections` REDIRECT: Connections folded INTO the
 *    Agent Studio (Home) as a GLOBAL view (those settings apply to ALL agents, so
 *    it's a Studio-level view switch, not a per-agent tab). The old rail path
 *    forwards to the Studio with its Connections view active.
 *  - `/voice` · `/messaging` · `/mcp` → `/?view=connections&tab=…` REDIRECTS: those
 *    three surfaces folded into the embedded Connections view, so the old paths
 *    redirect to the Studio's Connections view on the matching sub-tab — deep-links
 *    + Settings' "Configured on the X page →" links still land on the right place.
 *  - `/models` → `/settings` REDIRECT: the standalone Models page was demoted to a
 *    Settings section (model picker lives there now), so old links still land.
 *  - the catch-all `*` renders {@link NotFound} inside the shell, so an unknown
 *    URL shows a calm "not found" (with a link home) rather than a blank page.
